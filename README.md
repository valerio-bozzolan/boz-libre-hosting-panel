# KISS Libre Hosting Panel

Welcome in the **Keep It Simple And Stupid Libre Hosting Panel**, designed for GNU/Linux operating systems. This software can be useful to serve everyday shared hosting services.

This panel is designed to **respect the freedom** of its users. It works **without proprietary JavaScript**. To be honest, without **any line of JavaScript** in any form.

This panel is designed to work without **any external dependency** not written by me. This allow fine-grained control over the software. It integrates with well-known and ultra-secure software packaged inside every GNU/Linux distribution in the world and used by millions of devices.
